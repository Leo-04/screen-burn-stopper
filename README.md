# screen-burn-stopper
A simple windows app that is used to help mitigate screen burn

The default settings are:
- to appear after 60 seconds of inactivity
- you can press ```Del``` when the window shows up to close the progam
- it will not show up when you first open the program

These can be changed via the command line arguments (in this order)
